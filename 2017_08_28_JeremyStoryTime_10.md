## My story
As I was standing on the tower, I noticed some friends on a bridge.
I used a magnet to pick up their car off the bridge.
That cooked their electronics and made them upset.
They shot an arrow at me.
This caused a little drama, so I decided to pull them into the building for a talk.
We talked about the incident and got things taken care of.
Then Alissa told me about the bug she found.
I told Alissa she was a shining star and saved many of us several hours of our lives.
Then we looked at the clock and it was time to go.
